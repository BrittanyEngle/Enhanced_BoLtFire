# Enhanced_BoLtFire_Code

Climate change is expected to change both fire susceptibility and lightning activity in global boreal forests. The mechanics governing lighting-ignited wildfire (LIW) ignition remains, however, unclear, making predictions of future fire regions on a global boreal scale challenging. Here we examine short-term temporal impacts of weather on ignition probability using a novel dataset on LIWs in a quasi-experimental design of ignition and non-ignition lightning pairs. Specifically, our dataset comprises of 5,251 lightning pairs coupled with temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, lightning characteristics (polarity, multiplicity, duration, and peak current - available for scientific use from the ENTLN) and net primary productivity. This dataset provides new opportunities to model ignition dynamics of wildfires and offers deeper insights into lightning-driven fire activity.

The end python product is a csv file containing the below. The end R-Studio code provides the final model results. 

Dataset:
FireID: Unique identifier for the fire (LIW and NonLIW versions). Original LIW from the BoLtFire database

LIWType: Type of event: LIW (Lightning Ignited Wildfire) or NonLIW

offset: Days relative to the lightning event (0 = day of event)

holdover: Days between lightning event and fire observation 

FireSize: Size of the fire event (see methodology of Engle et al., 2025A) 

fire_type: Binary indicator: 1 (fire), 0 (no fire)

continent: North America or Eurasia

year: Year of the lightning event 

LC_Name: Land cover name (derived from MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Type Yearly L3 Global 500m (MCD12Q1))

LCDN: Land cover number (derived from MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Type Yearly L3 Global 500m (MCD12Q1))

EcoName: Ecoregion name (Olson et al., 2001)

NPP: Net Primary Production (MOD17A3HGF.061 Terra)

tp_mean: mean total precipitation (mm) for the 24-hour offset day (calculated from ERA5-Land)

t2m_mean: mean maximum 2m temperature (°C) for the 24-hour offset day (calculated from ERA5-Land)

ws_mean: mean maximum wind speed (m/s) for the 24-hour offset day (calculated per Pettinari & Chuvieco, 2017)

rh_mean: Mean relative humidity (%) for the 24-hour offset day (calculated per Wanielista et al., 1997)
